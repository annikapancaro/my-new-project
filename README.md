# AIproject

Final project for the Building AI course

## AI Project )

my project is about the things i leraned during the course


## AI project

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* my motivation is waking up every morning
* this problem is not a problem i wanna wake up every day thank you very much
  this topic is important because i am thankful for existing


## How is it used? its used because i exist and i am a human not saying that animals dont wake up every day i just wanted you guys to know that i am human

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # i think we should move it to the right 3 times

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

with the totPop and totFish I think the code is moving over 5 times for totFish and 3 times for totPop
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? - my data came from all of my brain I came up with this all by myself.
Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
- I actually collect it by someone else but I don't know their name.
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve?
- It doesn't completley explain the problem and the issue but I think I explained it pretty good.
  Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
  - I think that we could consider using the fox, chicken,chicken food, and robot problem because that worked pretty well for the past problems.

## What next?
Now I'm going to explain the questions below.

How could your project grow and become something even more?
- my project could grow by reaching out to people with more experience and they could help me make my project bigger and maybe get some more attention.
- What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
- I would need assistance from a person with better experiences to help me and teach me along the way
